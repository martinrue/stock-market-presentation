    <h2>What Is Trading?</h2>
    
    <div class="slide" id="what-is-trading-buying">
      <h3>Buying</h3>
      <p>Buy something now because you think it will appreciate in value</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="slide" id="what-is-trading-selling">
      <h3>And Then Selling</h3>
      <p>And sell it later at a higher price – the difference in price is profit</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Example: Going Long</h2>
    
    <div class="slide" id="example-going-long-buy">
      <h3>Buy</h3>
      <p>iPhones are going to appreciate, so we buy 10 at £500 each for a total investment of £5,000</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="slide" id="example-going-long-sell">
      <h3>Sell</h3>
      <p>And we're right – they appreciate to £550<br />£550 x 10 - £5000 leaves a total profit of £500</p>

    <h2>Nothing Groundbreaking</h2>

    <div class="slide" id="nothing-groundbreaking-price-up">
      <h3>Price Goes Up = Make Money</h3>
      <p>So far this probably fits with your mental model of the stock market. People buy shares, keep them for 30 years and make money if the price has risen</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="slide" id="nothing-groundbreaking-price-down">

    <h2>When Prices Fall</h2>

    <div class="slide" id="falling-prices-panic">
      <h3>Quick, Panic</h3>
      <p>Many assume that when the market is going down people are losing money</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="slide" id="falling-prices-shorting">
      <h3>Not Necessarily</h3>
      <p>Only those who are long (buying) are losing, but you can trade short (selling) too</p>

    <h2>Example: Going Short</h2>
    
    <div class="slide" id="example-going-short1-sell">
      <h3>Sell</h3>
      <p>This time, iPhones are going to depreciate, so we want to sell 10 of them</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="slide" id="example-going-short1-but">
      <h3>But</h3>
      <p>We don't actually have 10 iPhones, so we borrow them from people that do (for a fee) and sell them at their current price of £500</p>
    </div>

      <p>The price of an iPhone falls to £450</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="slide" id="example-going-short2-buy-back">
      <h3>Buy Back</h3>
      <p>We have £5000 and a debt of 10 iPhones, which we buy back at their new price of £450 leaving a profit of £500 - fee (£5000 - 10 x £450)</p>

    <div class="slide" id="bull-bear-money-in-both">
      <h3>Money Can Be Made In Both</h3>
      <p>Because you can buy and short sell, you can be on either side of a market movement</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="slide" id="bull-bear-black-wednesday">

      <h3>Hedging</h3>
      <p>But the stock market can be used for other purposes such as hedging</p>

    <h2>Hedging</h2>
    
    <div class="slide" id="hedging-what-is-it">
      <h3>What Is It?</h3>
      <p>Hedging allows us to protect ourselves from variable elements of a future contract</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="slide" id="hedging-how-it-works">
      <h3>How It Works</h3>
      <p>You take a position in the market that becomes profitable if your contract becomes more expensive and unprofitable if your contract becomes cheaper</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Example: Hedging</h2>

      <p>We've just entered into a contract to buy a machine from Germany for 100,000 euros, but it won't be ready for 6 months</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="slide" id="hedging-example1-cost-today">
      <h3>The Cost Today</h3>
      <p>EUR/GBP is currently 0.88, meaning our German machine will cost £88,000 today</p>
    </div>

  <section class="slide hedging" id="hedging-example2">
    <h2>Example: Hedging</h2>
    
    <div class="slide" id="hedging-example2-the-problem">
      <h3>The Problem</h3>
      <p>If the euro strengthens (insert laughter here), our German machine will cost us more money – if it moved to 0.98, the same machine would cost us £10,000 more</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="slide" id="hedging-example2-the-solution">
      <h3>The Solution</h3>
      <p>We buy EUR/GBP at the current price of 0.88 for 100,000 euros</p>
    </div>

  <section class="slide hedging" id="hedging-example3">
    <h2>Example: Hedging</h2>
    
    <div class="slide" id="hedging-example3-it-can-go-up">
      <h3>Now The Euro Can Go Up</h3>
      <p>If the euro appreciates to 0.98, the machine will cost £98,000 but we'll have made £10,000 on the EUR/GBP trade to account for it</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="slide" id="hedging-example3-or-down">
      <h3>Or Down</h3>
      <p>If the euro falls to 0.78, our trade will be losing £10,000 but the machine will now cost £78,000 – the total cost in both situations is £88,000</p>
